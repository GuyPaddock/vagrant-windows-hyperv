    virtual_switch_info: |-
      Vagrant works well with Hyper-V's External Switch. If you are using an Internal switch
      please make sure that this switch is properly configured for network connection.
      The virtual machine must be reachable from the host for Vagrant to work.
    no_private_switch: |-
      Vagrant cannot work with Hyper-V's private switch, since this configuration
      will not allow the host to communicate with the VM. Please refer to Hyper-V's
      virtual switch configuration for more information.
    external_switch_exists: |-
      Hyper-V allows to have only one external switch. There is one already available.
      Please check the Virtual Switch Manager in Hyper-V Manager.
      Ignoring the customization and moving on.
    private_switch_not_allowed: |-
      Vagrant cannot work with Hyper-V's private switch, since this configuration
      will not allow the host to communicate with the VM. Please refer to Hyper-V's
      virtual switch configuration for more information.
    internal_switch_warn: |-
      Vagrant works best with Hyper-V's External Switch. If you are using an
      Internal switch please make sure that this switch is properly configured
      for network connection. The virtual machine must be reachable from the
      host for Vagrant to work.

      no_network_adapter: |-
        No Network adapter is connected to this VM. Please use the HyperV Manage to add a network adapter.
      no_switches: |-
        There are no virtual switches created for Hyper-V! Please open
        the Hyper-V Manager, go to the "Virtual Switch Manager", and create
        at least one virtual switch.
        A virtual switch is required for Vagrant to create a Hyper-V
        machine that is connected to a network so it can access it.
        You can also use the customize option to add a virtual switch to this VM.
        For more help, please see the documentation on the Vagrant website
        for Hyper-V.
      network_down: |-
        The host network seems to be down, this generally happens while creating an
        external network, it looked like Hyper-V manager took a long time to bring back
        the network. Please check the network connection and try again.
      switch_not_found: |-
        A Virtual switch of type "%{type}" and name "%{name}" is not found, please
        create the same using Hyper-V "Virtual Switch Manager".
      external_switch_exist: |-
        Hyper-V allows to have only one external switch. There already exist one
        with name "%{name}"
