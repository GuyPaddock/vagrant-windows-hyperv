      Generating a RDP file to establish a remote session. You will soon be prompted to authenticate the
      RDP session and enter the Virtual Machine's password.
    message_rdp_not_ready: |-
        Hyper-V machine isn't running. Can't RDP in!
    choose_adapter: |-
      Please select a adapter from the available network adapters.
    choose_switch: |-
      Please choose a switch to attach to your Hyper-V instance.
      If none of these are appropriate, please open the Hyper-V manager
      to create a new virtual switch.
    virtual_switch_info: |-
      Vagrant works well with Hyper-V's External Switch. If you are using an Internal switch
      please make sure that this switch is properly configured for network connection.
      The virtual machine must be reachable from the host for Vagrant to work.
    no_private_switch: |-
      Vagrant cannot work with Hyper-V's private switch, since this configuration
      will not allow the host to communicate with the VM. Please refer to Hyper-V's
      virtual switch configuration for more information.
    external_switch_exists: |-
      Hyper-V allows to have only one external switch. There is one already available.
      Please check the Virtual Switch Manager in Hyper-V Manager.
      Ignoring the customization and moving on.

        Vagrant failed to communicate to the VM using powershell. The operation failed
        with the following message.
        %{message}
      no_network_adapter: |-
        No Network adapter is connected to this VM. Please use the HyperV Manage to add a network adapter.
      no_switches: |-
        There are no virtual switches created for Hyper-V! Please open
        the Hyper-V Manager, go to the "Virtual Switch Manager", and create
        at least one virtual switch.
        A virtual switch is required for Vagrant to create a Hyper-V
        machine that is connected to a network so it can access it.
        You can also use the customize option to add a virtual switch to this VM.
        For more help, please see the documentation on the Vagrant website
        for Hyper-V.
      network_down: |-
        The host network seems to be down, this generally happens while creating an
        external network, it looked like Hyper-V manager took a long time to bring back
        the network. Please check the netwotk connection and try again.
