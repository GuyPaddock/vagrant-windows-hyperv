      no_network_adapter: |-
        No Network adapter is connected to this VM. Please use the HyperV Manage to add a network adapter.
      no_switches: |-
        There are no virtual switches created for Hyper-V! Please open
        the Hyper-V Manager, go to the "Virtual Switch Manager", and create
        at least one virtual switch.
        A virtual switch is required for Vagrant to create a Hyper-V
        machine that is connected to a network so it can access it.
        You can also use the customize option to add a virtual switch to this VM.
        For more help, please see the documentation on the Vagrant website
        for Hyper-V.
